      <h1>Reviewing an application as a supervisor</h1>
      <h2>Email notification</h2>
      <h6>
        You will receive and email stating that have been selected as supervisor
        to a project. The student name and title of the project will be
        included. Attached to the email there will be a pdf which is the
        application of the student, generated by the system. In the application
        some links to other documents will be included (see the section The
        process/2. Applicant completes the form). You should read the
        application carefully making sure that: The information provided is
        correct The Aim and Objectives of the project are explained in simple
        (non technical terms) The Methodology of the project are explained in
        simple (non technical terms) The Safety concerns of the project are
        explained in simple (non technical terms) All necessary supporting
        documents are attached, and are properly adapted from the provided
        templates The questions are correct. Keep in mind that if major changes
        in the questions are required the student should reapply. At the bottom
        of the email you will have two options (see fig 1): Acknowledge receipt:
        Selecting this button if you completely agree with the application. This
        option will directly forward the application for ethics review. Comment:
        Selecting this option will open a browser window where you can add a
        comment to the student (see fig 2). IMPORTANT: In this window you will
        again have two options (Acknowledge Receipt or Request More Info).
        Selecting Acknowledge Receipt, will also forward the application for
        ethics approval, but send your comments to the student. If you want the
        student to make changes before the submission you should press the
        Request More Info link to send the application back to the student.

        If the application is deemed low risk it is likely that you will be
        assigned the reviewer. In this case see the page Guide for Reviewers
        When the student receives the approval you will also be notified and
        sent the approval letter (as a pdf).
